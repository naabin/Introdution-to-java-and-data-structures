Exception handling enables a method to throw an exception to its caller.

A Java exception is an instance of a class derived from java.land.Throwable. Java provides a number of predefined exception 
classes such as Error, Exception, RuntimeException, ClassNotFoundException, NullPointerException , and ArithmeticException.

Excecptions occur during the execution of a method. RuntimeException and Error and unchecked exceptions;all other exceptions are checked.

When declaring a method, you have to declare a checked exception if the method might throw it, thus telling the compiler what can go wrong.

The keyword for declaring an exception is throws, and the keyword for the throwing and exception is throw.

To invoke the method that declares checked exceptions, enclose it in a try statement.When an exception occurs during the execution of the method, the catch block catches and handles the exception.
